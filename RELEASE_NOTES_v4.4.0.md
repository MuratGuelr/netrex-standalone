# Netrex v4.4.0 Release Notes

Introducing v4.4.0, making the Netrex experience more vibrant, colorful, and much smoother! In this release, we focused on personalization, performance improvements, and refining the user experience.

## ✨ Highlights

### 🎨 Custom Status Colors
Now you can express your mood not just with words, but with colors too!
- **Color Picker:** Select a custom color for your status from the Settings menu.
- **Live Everywhere:** The color you choose will shine on both your name in the member list and your profile card.

### 👤 Profile Card Experience (User Profile 2.0)
We completely overhauled profile cards and made them ultra-responsive.
- **Instant Updates:** No need to reopen the profile to see if a user has started a game or changed their status. Everything is real-time!
- **Accurate Online Status:** The issue of appearing "Offline" while actually being "Online" is history.
- **Badge Adjustments:** Badges now look sleeker and cleaner. Unnecessary clutter has been removed.

## 🚀 Improvements and Changes

### 💬 Chat and Interface
- **Smooth Transitions:** Fixed the "grey screen" issue on the main screen when leaving a voice chat.
- **Loading Animations:** Instead of boring text while messages load, a stylish skeleton animation now welcomes you.
- **Drag & Drop:** Uploading images has never been this cool. A new full-screen effect awaits when you drag files.
- **Channel Management:** You can now close an open text channel by clicking on it again.

### 🛠️ Server Management
- **Badge Management (Beta):** Added a new "Badges" tab to server settings. (In development)

## 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Ghost Mode Fix:** You will no longer "hang" in the server when you close the application. The offline mechanism has been strengthened.
- **Microphone Animation:** Fixed microphone animations not working while speaking.
- **Camera Conflict:** Resolved image overlay errors that occurred when screen sharing and camera were opened simultaneously.
- **Build Optimizations:** Errors in Electron build processes have been cleared; the application is now more stable.
